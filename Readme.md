Youtube Count Project
============

------------

This is my side project that I used to learn more about actual data collection and modeling. I *realized* that the data I've been using in class setting are very clean and does not contribute to my full understanding of how data are collected (in this case, scrapped) and transformed into something useable.

Three majors thing I wanted to focus on learning:
  * Scrapping data from actual website (Youtube)
  * Transforming data into something useable
  * Constructing simple models to fit the data
  * Expressing my idea through a write up

This write up is published on Rpubs [here](http://rpubs.com/nlavee/youtubedata).

**Credits**: 
	1. I consulted [this blog](https://staesthetic.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/webscraping-youtube-using-r/) for an idea on how to start scrapping data from Youtube. It was a good start and provided a base for me to expand the code and take out more field that I needed to do my analysis.
	2. Professor [Lopez](http://skidmore.edu/mcs/faculty/mlopez.php) was a great mentor on providing me with inital thoughts on how I should do things. Greatly appreciate he taking the time out of class to answer my questions! :)
